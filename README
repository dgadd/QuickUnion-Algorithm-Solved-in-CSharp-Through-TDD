Quick Union Algorithm (from Sedgewick) Solved in C# using TDD

Chapter 1 explores a connectivity algorithm in increasingly complex iterations.

The goal of the connectivity process is as follows:
   1. be able to add pairs of connections as integers (2-3, 5-1, 8-7).
   2. The connections are transitive, so adding 2-3, 3-5, and 5-7 menas that 2-7 is also connected.
   3. Once a transitive connection exists, adding the direct connection (2-7) is redundant and
   therefore ignored.
 
THIS IS THE SECOND ALGORITHM APPROACH THAT THE CHAPTER PROPOSES: Quick Union Algorithm
(the first was "Quick Find" Algorithm).

In the Quick Union algorithm:
a) each index (the left connection, and the right connection) are traversed to their roots (see below)*
b) finally, the left root index is then assigned to the right root index

* To traverse each index to its root:

public int RootOfTreeFor(int index)
{
    var valueFromIndex = _intArray[index];
    
    // from index, get value, then treat it as index to get a new array value, UNTIL THEY MATCH
    while (valueFromIndex != _intArray[valueFromIndex])
    {
        valueFromIndex = _intArray[valueFromIndex];
    }
    return valueFromIndex;
}
